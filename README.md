# knowledge

This is a repository of all my notes, small scripts and commands that I've come up while programming. `main.md` is the main markdown document with all notes and it's separated into main categories (like linux, vim, git, hardware, etc). You can find other scripts in separate files or special directories.

Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong somewhere or contribute through issues
